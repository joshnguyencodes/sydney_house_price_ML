# Predicting Sydney House Price Using Machine Learning

In this project, I tried to use machine learning to predict house prices in Sydney, Australia based on a data set obtain on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexlau203/sydney-house-prices?resource=download).

I will keep on updating this project to improve the model's accuracy. This will be by feeding more data into the model and trying different machine learning models for better results. To view the project please open "house_price_notebook.ipynb".

# Predicting Sydney House Price Using Machine Learning

In this project, I tried to use machine learning to predict house prices in Sydney, Australia based on a data set obtain on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexlau203/sydney-house-prices?resource=download).

I will keep on updating this project to improve the model's accuracy. This will be by feeding more data into the model and trying different machine learning models for better results.
